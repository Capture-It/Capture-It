Functional Requirements
already mentioned. 

the user should sign in to get access to our service using auth0, then by default, once created, a user data inside one collection in our database will be initiated.
the info of the user is shared with the database n order to add/delete/update records in our database.
once access to the user photos is granted it can be shared publicly in which the other collection can render photos for different users with interaction methods.


Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only):

1-Usability=> having 2 collections for our database makes it easier to work on different pages.
2-Testability=> It can be run with relatively little preparatory effort, It can be tested with relatively few lines of code and It can be executed quickly.
